when you have multiple systems to run and only one playbook you have.
you may want to limit the execution steps based on the system. In such cases comes the use of conditional tag

"when"

- name:
  when: <<condition>>

  e.g.
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian' and
        ansible_distribution_version == '16.04'

readiness probe can be used to execute some commands to make sure that your service is live or not
in order to do this, you may need to incorporate this in pod definition file
When the application crashes, the container is restarted. During this period the service directs users to the available POD,
since the POD status is not READY.


If you have service exposed with the pods then the request will not be directed to pods until the reuest probe is available



3 types:

1. http
2. tcp
3. exec commands


readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
        path:
        port:
        #optional
        initialDelaySeconds: 10 <time which you think will be required to get app ready, after this time only the readiness
                                    probe request will be executed>
        periodSeconds: 5 <how oftern you want to execute readiness probe check>

        # by deafault readiness is checked for "3" attempts, which can be changed by
        failureThreshold: 8


I apologize for the urgency, would it be feasible to process my request by this or start of the next week? Since the company has been asking for CPT to get me on-boarded on June 1st.



readinessProbe:
    tcpSocket:
        port:

readinessProbe:
    exec:
        command:
            - cat
            - <file_path>
            -

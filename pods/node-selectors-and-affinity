Labela a node:

kubectl lable nodes <node-name> <label-key>:<label-value>


if you have multiple labels then its tough to decide on which node the pod should go and hence for that reason we have
node affinity

in pod definition

affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
        preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: # execute even if node doesnt exist
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: #execute only if node exists
            nodeSelectorTerms:
                -
                    matchExpressions:
                        - key: <key>
                          operator: <operator>/ Exists (checks if label exists, if so then executes)
                          values:
                            -
                            -
                            -

Accessing the service is all about rest calls, where you can automate the jobs by putting the token in Autohrizatiion
Bearer header in order to execute the calls.

Editiing serviceaccount for a running pod is not possible. For that you will need to stop and rerun the pod.


1)creating kubectl service:

kubectl create service <service-name>

2) get the service accounts

kubectl get serviceaccount


3) describe the service account

kubectl descrive serviceaccount <service-acc-name>

<token is stored as a secret object>

4) hence if you want to see the secret object then you will need to see that secret file

kubectl describe secret <secret-name/token-name>


5) getting secrets of the running pod

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> ls /var/run/secrets/kubernets.io/serviceaccount
//token files will be stored under this folder.

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> ls /var/run/secrets/kubernets.io/serviceaccount/token
//shows the token value for the same

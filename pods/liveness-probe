liveness probe is useful when you have some containers which are in exited state and you need to check if application
is live and only in that case you will create the container again.

If you have service exposed with the pods then the request will not be directed to pods until the liveness probe is available



3 types:

1. http
2. tcp
3. exec commands


livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
        path:
        port:
        #optional
        initialDelaySeconds: 10 <time which you think will be required to get app ready, after this time only the livenessProbe
                                    probe request will be executed>
        periodSeconds: 5 <how oftern you want to execute livenessProbe probe check>

        # by deafault livenessProbe is checked for "3" attempts, which can be changed by
        failureThreshold: 8



livenessProbe:
    tcpSocket:
        port:

livenessProbe:
    exec:
        command:
            - cat
            - <file_path>
            -

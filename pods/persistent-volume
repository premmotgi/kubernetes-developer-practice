persistent volumes can be used, where you create the pods which uses memory from the poop which is persistent
and then that memory can be accessed via normal stuff/normal hdd.

like pod definition file you can write a own definition file for this.

in production environment dont use the

path: key-value param as in definitio file. Supported cloud will have its own key-val. that is more safe to use.



these volumes can be accessed by persistent volume claims.

before giving access to the volume, kubernetes checks whether the claim can be satisfied or not. If the claim can be satisfied
then it maps that volume to the claim.[Uses Worst Fit approach in the OS]


Once you create a PVC use it in a POD definition file by specifying the PVC Claim name under persistentVolumeClaim section in the volumes section like this:



apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim


The same is true for ReplicaSets or Deployments. Add this to the pod template section of a Deployment on ReplicaSet.

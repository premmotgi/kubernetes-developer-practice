***)way 1 of creating the pod file:

kubectl edit pod <pod name> - opens the file to edit the pod definition file

edit the file and changes will be stored in some tmp folder!

kubectl delete pod webapp - delete the existing pod

kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml - this will create the pod from new editings


***)way 2 of creating the pod file:

kubectl get pod webapp -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml

take the definition in  some file

vi my-new-pod.yaml
edit that file

kubectl delete pod webapp
delete the current pod

kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml
deploy the newly edited pod

***)Edit Deployments

With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template.
Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification,
with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes.
So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command

kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
